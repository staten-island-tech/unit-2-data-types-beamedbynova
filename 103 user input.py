# the "input()" code requires user input before preforming the function.
# typically, functions that require user input actually USE that input.

# the variable "x_int" is a static integer.
# "answer" requires an input before anything else.
# the text "input a number" will show up, and you are required to enter in a number (or dont, u arent really required)
# the code then takes the input and converts it from a string into an integer because of the "int(x)" section
# the first print command prints out the number you inputted.
# the second print command prints out the value of x_int plus your answer.
x_int = 5
#answer = int(input("input a number"))
#print(answer)
#print(x_int + answer)

# the code below is a simple calculator that adds together 2 integers.
input1 = int(input("input the first number: "))
input2 = int(input("input the second number: "))
print(input1 + input2)
